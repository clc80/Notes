# Notes
Created a simple version of the apple Notes app

During this app I got to learned about:

* Display lists of information using table views
* Create custom table view cells in Interface Builder
* Create new view controllers
* Set up navigation controllers
* Use segues to transition between view controllers
* Trigger user-initiated actions using bar button items
* Create appropriate data models
* Pass data between view controllers
* Program the functionality to add, display, modify, and delete notes
* Connect app interface to app logic
* Persist data using the CoreData framework
* Create static helper methods
* Modify existing code to integrate data persistence
